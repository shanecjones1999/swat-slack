# swat-slack

This repository holds the Swarthmore Ultimate Frisbee slack workspace exported in July 2024. You can view the workspace through this website hosted on Heroku: <https://swat-slack-4d5bb6ee4530.herokuapp.com/>.

This project leverages the [slack-export-viewer](https://github.com/hfaran/slack-export-viewer) package to neatly display the exported slack data.
